  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Desalegn Tamirat</strong>.</p>
  <p>I graduated in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Addis Ababa Institute of Technology. My journey has led me to a fulfilling career in front-end development, where I enjoy creating visually appealing and interactive websites.</p>
  <p>In addition to my front-end skills, I have a strong foundation in Python and data structures, honed through extensive practice on LeetCode. This expertise makes me proficient in problem-solving and algorithm development.</p>
  <p>My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer, seamlessly integrating my front-end and back-end skills. I am particularly passionate about back-end development, where I find great satisfaction in building robust and efficient systems.</p>
  <p>Currently, I am also diving into the field of data science. Although I am still in the learning phase, I am excited about the potential it holds and am committed to mastering it.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I love exploring new technologies and continuously improving my coding skills. I believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and I am always eager to take on new challenges and grow as a developer.</p>
  <p>Thank you for visiting my website. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate on a project!</p>
